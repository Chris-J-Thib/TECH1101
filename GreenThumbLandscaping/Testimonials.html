                    <p>Our experience with Green Thumb Landscaping was awesome! They repaired our landscaping
                        in St.
                        Albert.
                        Christopher
                        Watson, in particular, was professional, polite and hardworking. He wanted to make sure we were
                        happy
                        with the job every
                        step of the way! Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done! Great job Christopher!

                    <p>I would personally like to extend my gratitude to Parks Landscaping Limited for the incredible
                        work they
                        did for my yard
                        in the Newcastle area. Not only did the crew work diligently to complete my yard in a timely
                        fashion,
                        they were very
                        nice and polite and went out of their way to ensure everything that I asked for was done. They
                        were
                        extremely patient
                        with the issues raised regarding some of the neighbours concerns. They were also always asking
                        me if
                        there was anything
                        more they could do which made me feel that they genuinely wanted to do their best work. The
                        landscaping
                        crew as a whole
                        was beyond fantastic and extremely polite and professional. In particular, I want to thank Matt
                        & Jimmy
                        (who worked on
                        the fence and deck) for being outstanding employees. They not only fixed and addressed all of my
                        concerns but they went
                        out of their way to make sure everything was completed at a high standard. For example, I had
                        mentioned
                        a concern about
                        the grass (even though they were not the ones who put it in) and the next day they brought new
                        sod in
                        and replaced the
                        bad parts. I would also like to extend my gratitude to Chad, as he too went above and beyond to
                        organize
                        everything I
                        asked for. From putting up with all of my phone calls, to following up with all my changes; he
                        made sure
                        our new yard
                        and deck was taken care of. I wanted to write this letter expressing how much I appreciate all
                        of the
                        crew's hard work,
                        and how impressed I am with Green Thumb Landscaping Limited.</p>

                        <b> Business Owner of Weststar Doll Makers Edmonton Alberta</b><br>
                        Green Thumb Landscaping took charge and made my landscaping happen. I had no clue of how to set
                        up my
                        yard, but they
                        came and gave me an awesome plan and executed. The city had put requirements on my property that
                        needed
                        to be met. I was
                        unsure on how to meet the requirements and stay within my budget. After a brief meeting with a
                        park
                        representative they
                        had created a plan that to fulfill the requirements and had booked a time to finish the job. A
                        great
                        thing when you are
                        spending so much money is to see the crew actually working swiftly and not taking long breaks.
                        Park's
                        guys worked
                        straight until dark each day to finish the job. I would totally recommend Green Thumb
                        Landscaping to
                        anyone. In fact, I
                        did recommend them to a neighbour down the street. He went with Park because they were able to
                        deliver a
                        prompt and
                        professional service. Thank you Green Thumb Landscaping for a job well done!

                    <p>We were very impressed. We've done a lot of work to our home and property and this has been by
                        far one
                        of the best
                        experiences! They met or exceeded expectations every step of the way. The planning process was
                        fun, the
                        job started the
                        day we'd planned for and the crew was fantastic, working full days until they were done, and
                        touching
                        base with me
                        whenever there were decisions to be made (no matter how minor). We had a patio area put in for
                        our fire
                        pit, added
                        walkways, pea gravel and mulch to the surrounding area and they levelled the lawn and put down
                        new sod.
                        The work was top
                        notch. Even more telling of the high level of professionalism is the care they put into follow
                        up.
                        They've contacted us,
                        come out to the house to take a look after the fact and actually asked for feedback to help them
                        do
                        better in the
                        future. I wish all companies cared about their craft as much as the team at Green Thumb
                        Landscaping Ltd.
                        When we're
                        ready to tackle the front yard we will definitely be working with them again and we would highly
                        recommend them to
                        others ðŸ™‚</p>

                        probably
                        those darn teenagers

                        we met
                        Mike, to the
                        fantastic office staff and the team who completed the job on site. It was a pleasure working
                        with all of
                        you and we are
                        happy with the finished product and the timely fashion the work was completed. We were very
                        happy with
                        how our questions
                        or inquiries were dealt with so proficiently and professionally by everyone.</p>

                    <p>I have used landscapers before and they are a very professional group. They showed up on time,
                        did fast
                        work and cleaned
                        up after every day. They took the time to ask me questions while ensuring what I wanted was
                        completed.
                        Great job and I
                        would recommend this company.</p>

                    <p>We are truly very pleased with the work your team has done on our project. Not only were the guys
                        and
                        gals all very
                        pleasant and accommodating, they always cleaned up after themselves. Anyone who has hired
                        contractors to
                        do work knows
