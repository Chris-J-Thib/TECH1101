            <h1>ABOUT GREEN THUMB LANDSCAPING</h1>

            <p>
                Green Thumb Landscaping got its roots in one of the greenest, most picturesque landscapes in the world -
                Ireland. The lush countryside of owner and operator John Duane's homeland is known to have “40 Shades of
                Green.”
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, John employs the most knowledgeable, capable and hardworking team. Each member contributes their
                own
                individual
                talents and strong suits, but they all have one thing in common - commitment to providing customers with
                quality products and
                courteous services.
            </p>

            <p>
                From regular lawn maintenance and installing sandstone steps to laying simple pathways and designing
                complex
                custom
                yards, our diverse team has the qualifications to make your vision reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                We take pride in even the smallest project, and are meticulous down to the last blade of grass. We take
                a
                customer-first
                approach to everything we do.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our team is creative, courteous, thorough and efficient, and communicates every step of the way to
                ensure
                your
                expectations are met.
            </p>

            <p>
                Green Thumb Landscaping treats outdoor spaces like indoor spaces. Rocks and debris are picked up and
                removed,
                entertaining areas and driveways are blown free of dust and dead and decaying vegetation is pruned away.
            </p>

            <p>
                No clean up required. When the work is done, the only thing left for you to do is kick up your feet and
                bask
                in your
                picture-ready surroundings. And you may not even know we were there.
            </p>
